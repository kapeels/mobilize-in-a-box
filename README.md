# miab (mobilize-in-a-box)
The start of a leaner, meaner mobilize-in-a-box.

## PLAN
  * Assemble the necessary docker containers to run the entire mobilize stack. 
  * configure a `docker-compose.yml` file to mash them all together.
  * generate a vagrant box that containers the docker daemon and runs docker-compose on boot.
  * provide some instructions for manual install.
